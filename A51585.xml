            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>THE Heroick Actions of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam III.</hi> in His Three Months Campaign in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is a Subject of ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime a Nature, worthy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe celebrated Authors of Antiquity that ſung the Praiſes of their Gods: And as none but the greateſt Maſters were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to draw the Pictures of any of the <hi>Cæſars;</hi> ſo it is to be wiſhed, there might ariſe among the Writers of this Age, ſome Pen equal to the other famed Pencils, that may be capable to hand down to Poſterity, ſuch Actions of King <hi>William,</hi> as the Ages to come will hardly have faith to believe.</p>
               <p>The King in this Campaign in <hi>Ireland,</hi> made good the Axiom of that learned Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>Zenophon,</hi> That a Prince ought to be the Soul of his Army: And if ever the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts Definition of a Soul could admit of a favourable Senſe, it was then, when His Majeſty was to His Army, All in All, and All in every Part, in the ſeveral Actions of the Campaign, where Honour and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity both did call Him, on that Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Day of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> in the Trenches, and under the Walls of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty behaved Himſelf to that Aſtoniſhing height of Courage, as to be able to ſay with as much Reaſon (or rather more) than he of Old, who was pleaſed to ſay of Himſelf, <hi>How many do you reckon me.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſame great Perſon, in his Life of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> tells us, There is ſomething of Emanation, that from the Soul of a Hero, communicates it ſelf to thoſe about them. This appears true of our Forces in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Preſence and Example of their Royal Leader ſeem'd to infuſe into them a Courage, as extraordinary, as the Cauſe, for which they fought.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty has ſo far imitated that Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Hero, <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> that 'tis evident he deſigns to ſurpaſs the Original. In One of that King's Letters to Chancellor <hi>Oxerſterm,</hi> who had kindly chid him for expoſing his Perſon in Battle; he tells him, If ever a Prince be obliged to ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Courage, he muſt do it at the beginning of a Conqueſt; 'Tis then <hi>(ſays he)</hi> he muſt provide a happy period to the War, by a fortunate Beginning; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to do this, he muſt conquer (as ſoon as poſſible) and he muſt conquer in Perſon,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94881:3"/>
His Renown (continues he) muſt go a great way before his Enſigns; and he muſt level the Walls, and open the Gates of Towns, by the alone Terror of his Name: Thoſe who after the Example of <hi>Alexander</hi> (adds this brave King) do quit their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to ſeek Glory and Empire in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt venture all, and by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Valour, muſt put a diſtinction betwixt them, and other Princes that live at home. Thus far <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus.</hi> And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there a nearer Parallel than betwixt his Famous Action at the Iſle of <hi>Rugen,</hi> which gave ſo great a Reputation to his Arms, at his firſt entry into <hi>Germany;</hi> and that of His Majeſty at the <hi>Bovne.</hi> The firſt made way for a Glorious Chain of Victories, which have gained the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> an immortal Name; and this laſt has made way for an intire Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for other Laurels yet to come. The many Advantages that attend this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Succeſsful Campaign in <hi>Ireland,</hi> we have ſeen in a conſiderable part already; but what innumerable Ones, are yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a little time will diſcover in a Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Light. Who can be able to count up the Thouſandth part of the Advantages the poor Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> have heap'd by one ſingle Victory? They only are fit to repreſent them, who are the one day penn'd up in dark Priſons, every Minute expecting that the firſt opening of the Door would uſher in upon them Harbingers of Death; and who the very next day thereafter, had thoſe Doors ſet wide open, at the approach of their Illuſtrious Deliverer. In fine, none can fathom the vaſtreſs of the Change that one ſingle Day has produc'd in <hi>Dublin;</hi> but he who having his Head laid down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Block, without hopes of taken it up again, has had a Pardon delivered him at the very nick of time, when the fatal Axe was lifting up, to give the blow.</p>
               <p>It's hard to determine whether this Iſland of <hi>Britain,</hi> or that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> has gain'd moſt by this ſucceſsful Campaign: As they out-vied one an other, in the greatneſs of the hazard they were in ſo they now out vye one another, in the greatneſs of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, the Dangers that this Iſland was lately in, is ſo well known, that there is the leſs need of delineating them. And I think no true Lover of his Country can look back upon them, but with ſuch a horror, as the now ſafe Paſſenger, does from the Shoar behold the raging Billows that threatned him ſome hours ago, with an inevitable Death. And I am perſuaded, that His Majeſties Succeſs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> has not only put <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> late ſinking Bark, within the ſhelter of a Bay, but placed her in a ſafe Harbour. In ſhort, this three Months Succeſsful Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign in Ireland has been to King <hi>William,</hi> what the fam'd <hi>Rubican</hi> was to <hi>Cæſar:</hi> But with this difference, that inſtead of <hi>Cæſar</hi>'s Deſign to enſlave <hi>Rome,</hi> that of our truly invincible Monarch, is to give Liberty to <hi>Europe,</hi> Aſſiſtance to his Allies, ſafety and repoſe to his Subjects, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a never-dying Glory to Himſelf.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ON <hi>Wedneſday, June</hi> 12, in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, His Majeſty accompanied with His Royal Highneſs, the Prince of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons of Quality, embarked at <hi>High-lake,</hi> and the ſame after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon went out to Sea, but the Wind wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering made not much way that day; but on <hi>Friday</hi> the 14th. the Wind proving fair, made amends for the ſlowneſs of the two former days Sailing; and on <hi>Saturday,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three in the Afternoon, His Majeſty came into the Lough of <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> with the whole Fleet that attended Him. His Majeſty on His Landing, immediately mounted, and rode on Horſe-back through the main Street of the Town, which was lined on both ſides with innumerable Crouds of People, who bid His Majeſty wellcome, with continual Shouts and Acclamations: At the <hi>White-houſe,</hi> half-way betwixt <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus</hi> and <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> His Majeſty was met by the Duke of <hi>Schenbergh</hi> in his Coach and Six Horſes; the King was pleaſed to a-light, and go into the Duke's Coach, attended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with one Troop of Horſe, and a few Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and immediately drove over the Strand to <hi>Belfaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uncertainty of the time, and place of His Majeſtys Landing, and the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the News was ſuch, that few of the Multitude that Flocked to <hi>Belfaſt</hi> to ſee it had their ends, the Generals motion was ſo quick; yet before they got into the Town there were abundance that met them, and coming to the <hi>North Gate,</hi> He was received by the Magiſtrates of <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, a Guard of the Foot-Guards, and a general continued Shout, and Shouts of <hi>God Save the King, God Bleſs our Proteſtant King, God Bleſs King</hi> William.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty went directly to the Caſtle, which had been ſome time before prepared for him, where he alighted, and went into an Apartment appointed for him, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gave Orders for the bringing aſhore 250000 <hi>l.</hi> with ſeveral Tons of Tin Half-pence and Farthings; and Expreſſes were ſent to the Agents of all Regiments, to bring in their Accompts by the 19th. in order to receive their Men's Pay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In order to which, His Majeſty concerted meaſures how to clear all Quarters, and diſcharge the Country; and gave Orders for the Train of Artillery to be ready to March in eight Days.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty was waited upon, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by Dr. <hi>George Walker,</hi> late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> and about Twelve of the Epiſcopal Clergy.</p>
               <p>At Night the Streets were filled with Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire-works, which were no ſooner lighted, but the Allarm Signal was given by diſcharge of Guns, ſo Planted, that from one place to another of the Armys ſeveral Winter-Quarters throughout the whole Country in our hands, in a few Minutes, all places had notice of the King's Arrival, and in a very few Hours made Bonfires ſo thick, that the whole Country ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the 1<hi>6th.</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> came to <hi>Belfaſt;</hi> as likewiſe a great number of Presbiterian Miniſters, who came to wait on His Majeſty, and preſented him with a Loyal Addreſs. A little after the King's

Landing at the Lough, betwixt <hi>Carrickfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> and <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> it ſeem'd to be like a Wood, there being in it between ſix and ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sail of Ships, moſt loaden with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Ammunition: The Plenty and Order of all things there was moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and not credible to any but thoſe that ſaw it, no Army in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> the like; and yet all Goods held a good Rate. His Majeſty continued at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> concerting Matters, and giving the neceſſary Orders for the opening the approaching Campaign, 'till the 19th. at which time he went to <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn,</hi> and Dined with the General, the Duke of <hi>Schonberg,</hi> and the ſame Night he went to <hi>Hilsbrough,</hi> accompanied with Prince <hi>George,</hi> Lord General <hi>Douglas,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and a great many other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry.</p>

This day Landed at the <hi>White-Houſe,</hi> 2500 Horſe from <hi>Scotland;</hi> a Camp was this day begun to be formed near <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deragee,</hi> about 20 Miles from <hi>Lisbourn</hi> and on the very Frontiers between <hi>Ardmagh</hi> and the <hi>Newry,</hi> whither all the Army is march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The 21th. This day was wholly taken up in forming the Camp.</p>
               <p>The 22th. His Majeſty went from <hi>Hils<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> to the Town of <hi>Newry,</hi> where he viewed the part of his Army that was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped there, conſiſting of 24000 Horſe, Foot and Dragoons; His Majeſty being informed by His Scouts there, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces, with their King, were come to a Paſs within four Miles of the <hi>Newry,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that and the Town of <hi>Dundalk;</hi> His Majeſty ſent a Trumpeter to acquaint the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> That in caſe they burnt any more Houſes, He had given Order to His Army That they ſhould not give Quarter to a Man, either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> they ſhould meet with. And that very Night His Majeſty gave Order for 500 Horſe and Dragoons to be detached, under the command of Lieutenant-General <hi>Schravemore,</hi> to march towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and mark out a place to Encamp in: The <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeeing ſome of the Horſe that were the advanced Guard ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and they thinking the whole Army was approaching, immediately quitted their Paſs, and Fled to <hi>Ardee,</hi> burning their Tents for haſte, but left the Town ſtanding, being apprehenſive that the King would be as good as His Word; ſome of our advanced Party marched ſo near the Enemy, that they plainly ſaw them ſet Fire to their Tents, and the confuſion they were in.</p>
               <p>The Paſſes being clear, His Majeſty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately advanced with the Forces from the <hi>Newry,</hi> towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for General <hi>Douglas,</hi> and the other Forces, to change their march before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them, and immediately to march and joyn him at <hi>Dundalk.</hi>

               <p>On the 27th. we Encamped on the Plains of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> where we reſted the next day, and underſtood that the Enemy were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>Ardee,</hi> and had Poſted themſelves; on the South ſide of the River <hi>Boyne:</hi> The King went himſelf the next day (with a ſelect Party of Horſe) beyond <hi>Ardee,</hi> to view the Ground; and on the 29th. we marched with the Army to <hi>Ardee;</hi> which we found miſerably Plundered by the Enemy, they leaving nothing but the Houſes with bare Walls, except ſome ſick, old, bed-ridden People, for murdering four of which in cold Blood, a Scotch Soldier and Woman was here hanged.</p>
               <p>On the 30th. His Majeſty Encampad in ſight of the Enemy, the River <hi>Boyne</hi> being between us and them: the King's Tent was pitched about a Mile ſhort of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> and as much above <hi>Drogheda.</hi> His Majeſty at His Arrival near the River about Noon, rode in full view of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, which lay encamp'd on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>The Enemy ſoon diſcovered it muſt be His Majeſty who was ſo attended, which made them draw down two Pieces of Six Pound Ball from the Forts a little higher,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94881:4"/>
and planted them oppoſite to the place where our Horſe were drawn up, they preſently began to fire, and one of the Balls paſſed ſo cloſe to His Majeſty, that it took away a piece of his Coat, Waſte-coat and Shirt, raiſed the Skin on the blade of his Right Shoulder, and drew a little Blood; but a Plaiſter being put on, His Majeſty continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Horſeback without the leaſt concern, till four in the Afternoon, when he Dined, and in the Evening was on Horſeback again, though he had been up from One in the Morning. The Enemy ſpent about two hundred Balls, and killed us four or five Men, and about ten Horſes. Here it was that our Horſe ſtood the Shot of the Enemy, every Man on foot by his Horſe ſeveral hours, while they paſs'd the ſhot before mentioned. At laſt, when the King had ſaid, <hi>Now I ſee my Men will ſtand,</hi> ſome Guns were ſent to our Horſe, and about five in the Evening, we brought ſome of our Guns to bear, upon the firſt diſcharge of which among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, they retreated from their Battery and ſtood farther off; we diſmounted ſome of the Enemies Guns on their Battery, and with our Bombs, beat down ſeveral Tents, next adjoyning to thoſe of the late King <hi>James,</hi> and the <hi>Count de Lazun.</hi> His Majeſty reſted very well all Night, and at Eight the next Morning, being <hi>July</hi> 1. (ever memorable for poor <hi>Ireland,</hi>) was again on Horſeback: and while the great Bullets were flying, the Prince of <hi>Dermſtadt</hi>'s Horſe was ſhot in the Neck. We underſtood, by a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter, that ſwam over the River laſt Night, That the Enemy were 25000 ſtrong, that they had ſent away ſome of their heavieſt Baggage, in order (as they gave out) to Fight us. The King command the Count <hi>de Schonberg,</hi> to march with all the Horſe and Dragoons of the firſt and ſecond Line, of the Right Wing, in all about 5000, and the Brigade of <hi>Trelawny,</hi> and to paſs the River about four Miles from the Camp, further up the River by <hi>Slane,</hi> where had been a Battery of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but they were drawn off, and only 800 Dragoons guarded the Ford; this was done in order to take the Enemy in the Flank, while the reſt of our Army paſs'd it nearer <hi>Drogheda,</hi> over againſt their Camp; which the Enemy perceiving, they marched part of their Army to oppoſe the Count <hi>de Schonberg,</hi> (who had already broke ſome of their Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons that advanced to hinder his paſſing the River) and drew them up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia about a Mile and a half from the place where he had paſs'd the River. In paſſing this Ford, our Men were forced to go down a verp ſteep Hill, and uneven way, yet the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons at the foot of the Ford, only once fired and retreated to a greater Body, who were coming to their aſſiſtance. The King being informed of what had paſſed on that ſide, ſent Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> with two Brigades of Foot, to reinforce the Count <hi>de Schonberg,</hi> who thereupon changed his Order of Battle, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Wing of Horſe on his Right, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother on his Left, and placing the Foot in the middle. In this poſture he marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy, after ſome ſmall reſiſtance, put them into diſorder, and followed them fighting as far as the Village called <hi>Duleek.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke</hi> had part in this Action as <hi>Mareſchals de Camp;</hi> mean time the King cauſed the reſt of the Foot of the firſt Line, conſiſting of the Brigades of <hi>la Meloniere,</hi> which was on the Right, of <hi>Hanner,</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> to march to the Ford wheae <hi>Douglas</hi> was poſted the day before, on the Right, over againſt the Village before mentioned near <hi>Drogheda</hi> (which at this time had a Garriſon of 800 <hi>Iriſh.</hi>) The three Battalions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards were at the head of them, and paſs'd the Ford on the Right over againſt the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage before-mentioned, from whence they beat the Enemy that were poſted there. The Battalion of <hi>la Melionere</hi> followed them on the Left; and theſe four Battalions being the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94881:5"/>
firſt that paſſed the River, ſuffered pretty much; of the latter, there were five Officers killed, and eight wounded, and about Sixty Soldiers killed and wounded. Monſieur <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>limote</hi> followed the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, with his Detachment of 600 Men, whereof mention was made before, and after them the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Cambon:</hi> And here it was that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Calimote</hi> receiv'd a Shot, of which he is ſince dead, and ſeveral of his Officers were killed upon the place: Duke <hi>Schonberg</hi> headed the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot Guards, and the King the <hi>Inniskilling</hi> Horſe; telling them they ſhould be his Guards that day. Some of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe oppos'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot, who fought up to the middle in Water, and were almoſt born down, before ſome Horſe (which they long called for) could come to their relief. It was in paſſing this Ford, that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> (famous for the Siege of <hi>Derry</hi>) was killed.</p>
               <p>The Brigade of <hi>Hanmer</hi> paſſed next, the Count <hi>de Naſſau</hi> being at the head of them, as Major-General; and the <hi>Danes</hi> paſſed on their Left, Commanded by the Prince of <hi>Wirtembergh.</hi> After theſe paſſed the Horſe of the Left Wing; but in the mean time ſome of the Enemies Squadrons (as before mentioned) advanced, and Attacked our Foot: And a Squadron of the Enemies <hi>Guard du Corps,</hi> pierced, with great Vigour, as far as a little Villige, where we loſt our great General, his Grace the Duke of <hi>Schon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg;</hi> who advanced thither to obſerve the Enemies motion. Thoſe that were about his Grace, had before done all they could to perſwade him to retire from thence, but they could not prevail with him. He was killed with a Carbine ſhot in the Neck, and three Cuts over the Head, and one on his Face. Captain <hi>Foubert,</hi> who was next to him, and had likewiſe receiv'd a Wound in the Arm, got from his Horſe to help the Duke, but he died immediately without ſpeaking a word. By this time the King had got over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; who in paſſing it with his Horſe, (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf engaging in the thickeſt) met with the like oppoſition. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe once gave way, but the King went himſelf and brought them up again, and at the head of the Horſe Charged the Enemy; who after ſome reſiſtance retired Fighting, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lieutenant General <hi>de la Hoquelle,</hi> and Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Lazun</hi> being with the Body who made head againſt the Count <hi>de Schonberg,</hi> the late King <hi>James</hi> himſelf not Engaging, but ſtanding at the Reer of them, on a riſing ground, out of harms way.</p>
               <p>The Enemy retreated from <hi>Defile</hi> to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file;</hi> our Horſe purſuing them as far as <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>July</hi> 2. The King ſent Monſieur <hi>de la Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniere,</hi> Brigadier General, with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 300 Foot, and 1000 Horſe, with 8 Pieces of Cannon, to inveſt <hi>Drogheda:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived there, the Governour receiv'd the firſt Summons with great Contempt; but the King ſending him word, That <hi>if they forc'd his Cannon to be fired on them, he would not give them any Quarter.</hi> This ſo frighted the Governour, that having kept the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter ſome time, he returned this Anſwer; That <hi>he would Surrender the place upon fair Capitulation,</hi> viz. <hi>To March out with Arms and Baggage, Colours flying,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but otherwiſe

he would defend the place to the laſt Extremity.

But the Officers of the Garriſon after having conſulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reſolved to yield, and the Capitulation being Signed, they delivered up a Gate, and marched out about an hour after, between thirteen and fourteen hundred Men, and were conducted to <hi>Athlone,</hi> the Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to wear their Swords.</p>
               <p>After which Monſieur <hi>de la Meloniere</hi> gave Protections to a great many <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who expected to have been plundered, and marched to joyn the Army; whom we ſhall leave for a little time, and give the Reader here an account of the Movements of the late King, and his Troops, and the Affairs in and about <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday June</hi> 13. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Dublin</hi> receiv'd the certain Account of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>'s Landing. Before this a Camp had been laid out by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> about <hi>Atherde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and the late King <hi>James</hi> had ordered his Army to Rendezvouz there from ſeveral parts of the Kingdom</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th. King <hi>James</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Dublin</hi> to joyn them with about 6000 <hi>French</hi> Foot, moſt old Soldiers, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well Arm'd and Clad; one Regiment of theſe were <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and were obſerved carefully for fear of Deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army encamped, made about 36000, all well Clad, and in good heart, both Horſe and Foot. The ſame day King <hi>James</hi> left <hi>Dublin,</hi> there marched in 6000 of the Countrey Militia, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Luterel</hi> and <hi>Mac Gillicuddy</hi> as his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, were left Governors.</p>
               <p>It was expected the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would have been much caſt down upon King <hi>James</hi>'s leaving <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the certain News of King <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi>'s Landing, but they were much the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they Triumphed and rejoyced as if they had got King <hi>William</hi> in a Pound, and the Day were their own. They were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured either that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet would cut of King <hi>William</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> or that an Inſurrection would be made there; for we were told that an hundred thouſand Men were ready to riſe, under the Notion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring for a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Dublin</hi> knew not what to think of theſe things, for they were kept as Priſoners of War, and ſuffered to know no more, nor enjoy any more than what the others pleaſed. But this the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt (becauſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſpoke leaſt of it) that ſome deſperate Perſons had undertaken to Deſtroy King <hi>William</hi> as ſoon as he ſhould come aſhoar: For the great aſſurance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> could not be imputed to any other thing than this. Some were ſo open, as to tell their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Friends very lately, <hi>That they would be glad to go to Maſs within this Twelve Month:</hi> with ſeveral other Expreſſions of the like nature.</p>
               <p>The great concern of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Dublin</hi> was, how they ſhould be preſerved from being Plundered and Burnt, in caſe of the Defeat of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army; this they thought could be done only by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> purſuing the Victory cloſe (for by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Providence, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had neglected all this time to fortifie <hi>Dublin</hi>) or elſe by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Party by Sea, to Land at the Bay at the time of the Engagement; neither of which, as it afterward happen'd, was done: But God alone preſerv'd the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> by an extraordinary Deliverance.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thurſday, June</hi> 19. After King <hi>James</hi> was gone to Encamp, about Twelve at Noon, the Governour ordered all Perſons walking the Streets without Swords or Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onets, which was the Badge of Proteſtants, to be taken up and ſecured in Parades. At
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94881:6"/>
Night he pickt out whom he thought fit, and ſent them to ſeveral Priſons, where they were conſiderably incommoded.</p>
               <p>After this followed a Proclamation, <hi>That not above Five Proteſtants ſhould meet in any place, above the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, on pain of Death.</hi> By which they were from that time ſhut out from our Churches, which by an extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, they had enjoyed all theſe times (except <hi>Chriſt Churh.</hi>) Moſt of them were frequented twice every Day at Prayers. The Church-men, who ſtayed in the City, though they had loſt all their Subſiſtance by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament, except what People voluntarily contributed, acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a great deal of Zeal and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, being particularly influenc'd by the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> and Dr. <hi>King,</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Patricks,</hi> who have been the Bulwark of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in theſe ſad times.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> 24. Dr. <hi>King</hi> was clapt up in the Caſtle, and many other of the principal <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the College, (which was now a Gariſon) and other publick places. The <hi>Galway</hi> Proteſtants, being about 200, (theſe were they of Sir <hi>Thomas Southwel</hi>'s party, which were lately brought to <hi>Dublin,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be exchanged) were removed from <hi>White Fryars</hi> to the <hi>Round Church,</hi> and all the <hi>Newgate</hi> Priſoners were put to them, where they were near ſtifled. The Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War were brought from <hi>Kilmainham</hi> to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church; the publick Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, which hitherto had been very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral every Lord's Day, to their Relief, were now intercepted, and the Poor began to ſuffer much; few Proteſtants daring to walk the Streets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday</hi> the 28th. News came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army retreated, and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Army were come towards <hi>Droghedah,</hi> and ſeemed to preſs forward for <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the 29th. the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army came on this ſide the <hi>Boyne;</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> as it ſhould ſeem, diſtruſting the Iſſue, Sir <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Trant,</hi> Firſt Commiſſioner of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and another Gentleman, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to go from <hi>Dublin</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Waterford,</hi> to prepare Ships.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 1ſt. Early in the Morning, the Proteſtants in <hi>Dublin</hi> were wakened by an Alarm, and the News that there would be a Battle: The Gates of the City were kept ſtrictly Guarded, and the Proteſtants kept their Houſes. The Iſſue they expected with the greateſt apprehenſions: Several Reports were ſpread abroad every Hour; one while that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet were in the Bay; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that a <hi>French</hi> Expreſs was come from <hi>Waterford,</hi> with the news of taking the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> and of their being gone to <hi>Dover;</hi> then, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Right Wing was quite routed; then, that the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> was taken Priſoner: But at Five that Afternoon, ſome that had made their eſcape on tired Horſes, told the Proteſtants, The <hi>Iriſh</hi> were much worſted; and others at Six, That they were totally defeated; from hence, till One that Night, all the Entries of the Town were filled with duſty, wounded and tired Soldiers and Carriages, perpetually coming in.</p>
               <p>After theſe, ſeveral of King <hi>James</hi>'s Horſe Guards came in ſtragling, without Piſtols or Swords, and could not tell what was become of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Near ten that Night, he came in with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 200 Horſe, all in diſorder: The Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants concluded now, that it was a total rout, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army were juſt ready to come into Town; but were greatly Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, when an hour or two after, they heard the whole Body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, in very good order, with Kettle-Drums; Haut boys, and Trumpets; and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next Morning the <hi>French,</hi> and a great Party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot.

                  <hi>Wedneſday, July</hi> 2d. About five this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. King <hi>James</hi> having ſent for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord Mayor, and ſome Principle Perſons to the Caſtle, made a Speech to them to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, <hi>I had a very good Army in</hi> England, <hi>and when I had the greateſt occaſion for them, they deſerted Me, and went to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and finding a total Defection againſt Me there, I retired and went to</hi> France, <hi>where I was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by that King, and had all the Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances imaginable from Him, to Re-eſtabliſh Me in My Throne: In ſome time after, I came to this Kingdom, and found My</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>Subjects here, as well equipp'd and prepared to defend My Cauſe, as their Abilities could bear; And tho' I have often been told, That when it came to the Touch, they would never bear the brunt of a Battle, I could never credit the ſame, till now; when having a good Army, and all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations fit to Engage any Forreign Invader, I found the total Truth of which I had been ſo often Cautioned And tho' the Army did not deſert Me here, as they did in</hi> England; <hi>Yet when it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I therefore Charge you, on Your Allegience, That you neither Rifle the City by Plunder, nor Deſtroy it by Fire, which in all Kingdoms will be judged very Barbarous, and muſt be believed to be done by My Orders; and if done, there will be but little Mercy expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from an Enemy thus Enraged.</hi> He told them, <hi>Tho' he quitted</hi> Dublin, <hi>He did not quit his Inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

'Tis ſaid, he did not ſleep till he got on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; and having been once driven in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, is ſince clear gone off.</p>
               <p>All this day being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> nothing was to be ſeen in <hi>Dublin,</hi> but Officers and Carriages, and the Principal Perſons of the Town, their Wives and Families going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; others coming in duſty and weary, getting away as faſt as they could. About tour in the Afternoon the Proteſtants were affrighted with the appearance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, which were drawn out of the City early in the morning, and which they hop'd had been quite gone, entering into the Town, followed by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot, in a full Body; but they on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

At laſt, he reſolved to march alſo, and to drive two or three hundred of the Principal Priſoners before him: but while they were preparing for this, a falſe Allarm was ſpread, that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being Landed at the Harb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, were juſt at the Towns-end; it was too dusky to diſprove this by View, and they had not leaſure to ſend a Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Proteſtants now began to look out, not knowing well in what Condition they were in, but venturing to the Caſtle, they found Capt. <hi>Farlow,</hi> who had been a Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there, keeping Garriſon alone.

                     <p>As for others of Superiour Rank and Quality, and alſo ſuch as have born Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under Our Enemies, whether Military or Civil; That which at preſent we do declare is this: That if any of them ſhall within the time aforeſaid ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Our Obedience, and ſhall be content, during the Rebellion in this Kingdom, to betake themſelves to ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:94881:9"/>
Town or City as ſhall be aſſign'd them, they ſhall be ſecure in their Lives, and have the Liberty of ſuch Town or City; and if they are deſtitute, and in want, ſhall alſo have a Subſiſtence allow'd them, according to their reſpective Qualities; and the ſame ſhall be paid them by the Commiſſioners of Our Revenue, till by the bleſſings of Peace, We may be in a Condition to conſider all Our Loving Subjects, and thoſe in particular, who ſhall have been moſt early in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards Us. As to Strangers of what Nation ſoever they be, who have taken Service in this Kingdom againſt Us, We do farther Declare, That if they ſhall forſake the Enemy, and come into Our Quarters within the time aforeſaid, they ſhall not only receive Our Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whilſt they are in the Kingdom, but forthwith have Paſsports given them to go directly home into their reſpective Countries: But if theſe Manifeſtations of Our Grace and Favour ſhall not be valued as they deſerve; or if any ſhall perſiſt in that barbarous and Unchriſtian way of Burning and Deſolation, which in ſome places hath of late been practiſed; We ſhall hold Our ſelves diſcharged of thoſe Conſequences and Calamities which muſt inevitably follow, ſince thoſe who are obſtinate againſt Our Mercy become the Authors of their own Confuſion.</p>

               <p>The ſame week was Publiſhed a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation concerning the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts hiding their Arms and Amunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which, was as followeth. That notwithſtanding it was Notoriouſly known, that the Papiſts of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of all Ranks and Degrees, were lately very well furniſhed with Fire-Arms, Swords, Bagonets, Skeins, Pikes, Half-Pikes; Scythes, and other Arms Offenſive and Deffenſive; as alſo with great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gun-powder. And although Hi Majeſty in His Royal Proclamation of the Seventh of <hi>July,</hi> did Extend, and hold forth His Mercy and Compaſſion, to all Citizens, Towns-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Aſſured them not only of Pardon; as to their Lives and Liberties, for all Violences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo ſecurity in their Goods, Stacks of Cattle, and Chattels Perſonal; and that thoſe of any other Rank, or Quality with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in His Majeſties Quarters, and Obedient to Him, ſhould not be diſquieted in any ſort, without His particular Command. And nothing more was expected on their parts, but either to continue in, or return to their reſpective Dwellings, and to give us their Arms, and to follow their ſeveral Trades and Callings. But although ſeveral Perſons had laid hold on His Majeſties ſaid Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and are received into His Royal Protection, yet, few of them had brought in their Arms, and moſt of thoſe brought in were broken, which His Majeſty looked upon as an high Contempt, and done out of a Wicked Deſign, on any Oppertunity to joyn with the Rebels. Therefore to the end, that all Perſons might be left without Excuſe, and prevent the fatal Conſequences of their Contempt, and Diſobedience; His Majeſty ſtrictly Commands all Perſons, of the Popiſh Religion within the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who reſide in any part under His Majeſties Obedience, that they do within Ten days after the Publiſhing this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the City, or Shire Town of that County, wherein they reſpectively Dwell, or Reſide, Surrender, and Deliver all the Fire Arms, Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, which they lately had in their own Cuſtody, or in the Cuſtody of any other for their Uſe, To the next Mayor Chief Magiſtrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the City, Town or Country, where they reſpectively Dwell or Reſide; Who are required to Regiſter the ſame, and to return a perfect Liſt of ſuch Arms, and Amunition as they ſhall receive
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94881:10"/>
by Vertue of the Proclamation; as alſo, to lodg the ſame in ſome ſafe Garriſon of His Majeſties that is neareſt adjacent.</p>
               <p>And His Majeſty further Declares, that if the aforeſaid Perſons of the Popiſh Religion, do not by the time limited deliver their Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhall be looked upon as Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of His Royal Authority, and as Perſons deſigning the Diſturbance of His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as Traytors and Rebels, and will accordingly abandon them, to the Diſcreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His Soldiers, or they ſhall be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Goal without Bail or Main-priſe.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty likewiſe Commands all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of the Kingdom, That they do not keep or conceal any Arms or Ammunition belonging to any Papiſt, but that they be forthwith delivered to the Magiſtrates and Officers aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time was likewiſe Publiſhed, the following Proclamation.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſty receiving an Expreſs at <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Izard,</hi> from the Camp, That the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had drawn together moſt of their ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Troops, about <hi>Lymerick,</hi> were grown ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Impudent, and ſeem'd to have new Life and Vigour put into them, upon His Majeſty's retiring from the Camp, and that they were reſolv'd to make a deſperate Defence of the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> when-ever Beſieged: On which His Majeſty altered His Reſolutions, reſolving to return to the Camp, the better to diſpoſe of things for the puſhing on the Siege, and ſent Order to Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> to March from <hi>Athlone,</hi> and joyn the Count <hi>De Solmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>July</hi> 27. We Marched from <hi>Carick,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Count <hi>De Solmes;</hi> His Majeſty, as aforementioned, having left the Camp, and came the ſame day to the Town of <hi>Clonmel,</hi> which is Eight very long Miles: This Place ſeems to be very ſtrongly Scituated, and doubtleſs might have held out for ſome time, had it been Garriſoned by any but <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Men.</p>
               <p>The 28. We Marched Seven Miles farther; and the next day, being the 29. We Encamp'd at a place called <hi>Goolin-Bridge,</hi> which is about 23 Miles from <hi>Lymerick:</hi> Here, as ſoon as we Arriv'd, we had the confirmation, That the <hi>French</hi> had poſſeſs'd themſelves of the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and that they would not ſuffer any of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces to come into it, having turned out thoſe few that were in Garriſon there. On the 30. and 31. We lay quiet in our Camp, and refreſhed our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> the firſt, A Detached Party of the <hi>Inniskilling</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Marched from our Camp, and advanced within ſight of the Enemy near <hi>Lymerick,</hi> who, upon the approach of the advanced Parties, were in great conſternation; and they brought an account, That the Groſs of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, conſiſting of about 27000 Men, were (upon the hearing of the Advance of our Army) retired from beyond the <hi>Shannon.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3. A Deſerter came into our Camp from <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and told us, That yeſterday Morning, the ſecond Inſtant, he ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Infantry March out of the Town, about 3500 ſtrong, with Eight Field Pieces; (leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral of their Ingineers and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Town); and that the common report was, That they were going to <hi>Galway</hi> to Embark there for <hi>France,</hi> that being a more convenient Port for their taking Shipping than <hi>Lymerick; Galway</hi> being but Nine Miles from the Mouth of the Bay, and <hi>Lymerick</hi> is Sixty: And that as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> had quitted the Place, and were marched out, Three Regiments of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Auxillaries, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Lutterel,</hi> marched in, and took Poſſeſſion of it. This Advice afterwards confirm'd, as well by our Parties that had been ſent out, as by other Deſerters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4. The Regiments that were ſent to reduce the Town of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and Fort of <hi>Dancannon,</hi> under the Command of Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> joyned our Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5. A Detachment of Six hundred Horſe were ſent from our Camp, to reinforce the Garriſon of <hi>Youghal,</hi> and prevent any Deſign the Enemy may have upon it; and this Evening Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> joyned us from <hi>Athlone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 6. Our Army, conſiſting now of 38500 Effective Men, decamped from <hi>Goolen-Bridge,</hi> and Marched in Two Bodies towards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the Infantry taking their way by a place called <hi>Sallawood,</hi> and the Cavalry marched the other Road by way to <hi>Cullen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 7th, About Noon, we came to a place called <hi>Carickelliſh,</hi> which is between five and ſix Miles from <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and here our Horſe and Foot joyned in one Body again, and in the Afternoon ſome ſmall Detached Parties were ſent to obſerve the Poſture and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94881:11"/>
Motions of the Enemy; but on the approach of our Men, the Enemy retired in great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation from place to place, and in the Night burnt a great many ſmall Houſes and Cabins within Three Miles of the Town; and this Evening was held a great Council of War in the preſence of His Majeſty, where Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions were taken to Attack the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces early the next Morning; which were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and had Intrenched themſelves in all the Defiles leading thereto; having firſt Plowed up the Ground, made great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſmall Forts, threw Timber and Trees acroſs, and did all that poſſibly could be done to obſtruct the Paſſage of the King's Forces; leaving the Hedges, Gardens, and other places for Five Miles together, with Muſqueteers, in the nature of an Ambuſcade.</p>
               <p>On the 8. At One in the Morning, His Majeſty ſent out Nine Hundred Horſe, and Two Hundred Foot, Detached out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Oxon, Trelawny, Cuts, Laneer, Lloyd,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> under the Command of the <hi>Heer Bentinck,</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and Brigadeer <hi>Stewart,</hi> &amp;c. who advanced within Cannon Shot of the Town, notwithſtanding the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made by Three Regiments of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Foot, one of Horſe, and another of Dragoons, who ſtood but one Firing, tho' they had the covert of the Hedges, through which they Fired. About Four hours after, this Detachment returned to our Camp, and gave the King an account of the poſture the Enemy were in. And about Seven a Clock His Majeſty went himſelf with a freſh Party of 200 Select Horſe, being accompanied with Prince <hi>George,</hi> Major General <hi>Gnickle,</hi> the <hi>Heer Overkirk,</hi> and other great Officers, they approached within Two Miles of the Town. The Enemy were come ſo near, with ſome of their Out-guards, that we could hear them Talk with their damn'd <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brogue on their Tongues, but they were ſeparated from us by a Bog, which was very deep, and ſo ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that we could not poſſibly Attack them. This Night it was reſolved at a Council of War, that the Army ſhould March towards the Town, in order to Battle; for we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as you have heard, That the Country being very cloſe, and full of Hedges and Ditches, the Enemy had lined them to defend the approaches to the Town. Accordingly the next day, being the 9th, our whole Army Decamped by Five in the Morning, Colonel <hi>Earl</hi> leading the Van, with Two Hundred Horſe and Dragoons, and One Thouſand choſen Foot out of all the Regiments in the Army, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Forreigners.</hi> Upon our approach we found the Enemy drawn up within Two Miles of the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> whereupon Colonel Earl ordered his advanced Troops to make a Halt until the reſt were come up. Then our Horſe puſhed them for near a Mile; their Horſe at firſt made a ſhew as if they would make vigorous Reſiſtance, and ſtood our firſt Charge, but ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave way, when they threw themſelves behind the Hedges, and Fired ſo from thence, that our Horſe could not come to them. Upon which we brought ſome ſmall Field-Pieces to Fire upon them; and at the ſame time the 1000 Detached Foot were ordered to Attack them. Accordingly, about One a Clock, Colonel <hi>Earl</hi> led on his Foot, who run on with that Bravery, tho' the Enemy made a great Fire through the Hedges, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued this ſort of Fighting for Two Hours, advancing within Four Hundred yards of the Town, and poſſeſſing themſelves of Two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Poſts, called <hi>Ireton's-Fort,</hi> and the <hi>Old Kirk,</hi> and ſuch was the Bravery, Courage, and Reſolution of our Men, that their Officers could hardly ſtop them there, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were told it was His Majeſty's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Order. Then the Beſieged began to Fire from the Town with their Great Guns, which killed us ſome Men; but in all this days Action we had not above 35 Killed and Wounded, tho' above 250 of the Enemy were Killed in their ſeveral Retreats, among which were ſeveral Officers of Note, beſides divers taken Priſoners. Our Pioneers were imployed moſt part of the Afternoon in levelling the great number of Trenches the Enemy had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94881:11"/>
caſt up for their Defence.</p>
               <p>Between Six and Seven in the Evening His Majeſty ordered a Trumpeter to be ſent with a Summons to the Town, and as the Deſerters hath ſince Informed us, a great part of the Garriſon, with ſome of the Officers, were for Capitulating; but Monſieur <hi>Boiſeleau,</hi> who is Governor, Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Lutterel,</hi> &amp;c. reſolutely oppos'd it, making a Speech to the Garriſon of the great Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions there were in <hi>England;</hi> and that 50000 <hi>French</hi> had made a deſcent, and ſaid, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would be obliged to draw off His Army in few days, to defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England;</hi> and thereupon prevailed upon them to ſtand to their Arms. The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter was ſent back with this Anſwer from Monſieur <hi>Boiſeleau</hi> the Governor, <hi>That as King</hi> James <hi>had intruſted him with that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, he would recommend himſelf to the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>by a vigorous Defence.</hi> About Eight at Night the King went to his Camp a little Mile from the Town, having been on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back from Four in the Morning, giving the neceſſary Orders, and expoſing himſelf amidſt the greateſt of dangers, wherein His Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Denmark</hi> did every where accompany His Majeſty. The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ceas'd not all the while to Play from the Town, ſeveral of the Shot coming over His Majeſty's Tent, and ſome falling near it. The ſame Evening a Party of the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and other Dragoons, was ſent to view the Ford at <hi>Annaghbeg,</hi> a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Two Miles above the Town, where Six of the Enemies Regiments of Foot, Three of Horſe, and Two of Dragoons (Commanded by <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Lutterel</hi>) were Poſted on the other ſide of the River, with a Breaſt-work to cover them; who all Fired upon our Men, but being ſuch extraordinary Markſmen, they neither Killed nor Wounded any of them.</p>
               <p>The Enemy being thus poſted ſo very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly, that we expected to have met with great difficulties and oppoſition in paſſing the River, which is very Rapid, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom Stony; but the Enemy in the middle of the Night abandoned their Station with great precipitation, ſo that Lieutenant General <hi>Ginkle,</hi> and Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> who were Commanded by the King with a Detachment to force their way over, paſſed the River the next Morning early, being the 10th, with about Five Thouſand Horſe, Foot, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, ſelected out of the ſeveral Regiments, the Horſe and Dragoons firſt, and the Foot afterwards, who went almoſt to the middle in Water, and yet the River is ſhallower now than has been known for many Years. About Eight a Clock the King went over in Perſon, accompanied with His Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the <hi>Heer Bentink,</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Overkirk,</hi> &amp;c. and Three Regiments of Foot, with ſome Pieces of Cannon, were poſted there. About Four in the Afternoon, His Majeſty, upon the Information he had receiv'd by ſome Deſerters, That the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was with a ſmall Camp about Six Miles from <hi>Lymerick</hi> in the Road to <hi>Galway,</hi> ſent out a Party of Horſe, under the Command of a Lieutenant Colonel, to get a farther account of them, but they were retired from thence before our Men came up: We had likewiſe an account this Night brought to our Camp, by a Deſerter, That the Count <hi>De Lauſun</hi> lay with his Men near the City of <hi>Galway,</hi> the People there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to receive them into the Town.</p>
               <p>The 11. was ſpent in viſiting the ſeveral Poſts, and giving the neceſſary Orders about the Siege.</p>
               <p>The 12. His Majeſty Commanded Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer <hi>Stewart,</hi> with a Detatchment, and Four Pieces of Cannon, to go early this Morning and Attack <hi>Caſtle Connel,</hi> which is of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Strength, ſcituated on the <hi>Shannon,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four Miles from <hi>Lymerick.</hi> There were in it above 140 Men, Commanded by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Barnwel,</hi> who had refuſed to Surrender upon the Summons ſent him the Night before, but no ſooner ſaw the Cannon, but ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>The ſame day Advice came into our Camp, That General <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> having with 5 or 600

Horſe and Dragoons paſſed the <hi>Shannon,</hi> Nine Miles above <hi>Lymerick,</hi> had about Two that Morning, ſurpriſed near a place called <hi>Cullen,</hi> Eight Pieces of our Cannon, of 18 Pound Ball, which were coming with ſome Waggons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Powder and Ball from <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> under the Guard of a Squadron of Horſe and a ſmall Party of Foot. The Enemy Killed all they met, Men, Women, and Children, in all about ſixty, the reſt eſcaping; the Women and Children that belonged to the Wagoners and Gunners they Murdered moſt Barbarouſly in their Beds; they Blew up the Powder, which burſt Two of the Guns, the other Six, with the Pantons being left intire, and fit for Service, and they likewiſe Burnt ſome of the Carriages: Their haſt and diſorder was ſo great, that they could carry nothing away with them, but left behind them ſeveral things untoucht, as alſo the Carriage Horſes, which were looſe at Graſs. Sir <hi>Albert Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> with part of his Regiment of <hi>Innis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing</hi> Dragoons, that lay not far from thence, being timely Alarm'd by a Deſerter march'd immediately towards the Enemy, charged them, killed about Twenty, with a Major and a Captain, and purſued them as far as was ſafe. Sir <hi>John Lanier,</hi> who upon the news of <hi>Sarsfield</hi>'s March, was, by the Kings Order, ſent from the Camp with a Detatchment of Horſe, came within Three Miles of them, and being informed of what had happened, ſtruck off to <hi>Kilcullen Bridge</hi> to cut off their Retreat, but the Enemy retired by the way of <hi>Athlone.</hi> This accident hindred us five or ſix days, which we ſpent in preparing our Batteries, and put all things in a good poſture for a vigorous Attack of the Town.</p>
               <p>On the 14. An Expreſs came to our Camp from <hi>Youghal,</hi> giving an account, that the Garriſon there conſiſting of 50 Foot, and 36 Dragoons, hearing what miſchief the Rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries did in the Country, and that there was a great number of them at <hi>Caſtle-Martyr;</hi> the Officers that Commanded drew out both the Horſe and Foot, and Marched to Attack them, but the Foot not being able to March ſo faſt as the Dragoons, the latter met near <hi>Caſtle-Martyr,</hi> 300 Raparies Horſe and Foot, and immediately Routed them, killing 60. and taking 17. Priſoners, and the Foot being come up, they Summoned the Caſtle, which Surrendred upon Liberty to go to <hi>Cork,</hi> but without their Horſes and Arms, which being done, the Soldiers took the Horſes, and the Arms were given to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Inhabitants, and ſo they returned to <hi>Youghal.</hi> While this was doing, Captain <hi>Price,</hi> and Captain <hi>Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> Commanders of the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Men of War, who were then at <hi>Youghal,</hi> being informed, That there were Two Ships in <hi>Cork</hi> Harbour, Laden with Hides and Tallow for <hi>France,</hi> they Sailed to the Harbours Mouth, and ſending in their Boats, brought away the Two Ships, and carried them to <hi>Waterford.</hi>

               <p>On the 17th, The whole day was ſpent in making the neceſſary Preparations, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things ready for the opening of the Trenches, which in the Evening was put in Execution, the Trenches were opened with Seven Battallions, conſiſting of <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Infantry, Commanded by the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> Lieutenant General, Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> Major General <hi>Petteau,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis</hi> Brigadeer. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced this Night about 300 paces, and took Two Redoubts from the Enemy, from whence they might have diſturbed our Workmen. The 18th, about 10 at Night, the Trenches were Relieved by Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sidney,</hi> and Count <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Major Generals, and Brigadeer <hi>Stewart,</hi> with Seven Battallions of Foot, and this Night we made our regular approaches towards another ſtrong Redoubt of the Enemies, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Night was exceeding dark, that had it not been prevented by the extraordinary care and dilligence of the Officers, our Men had certainly fallen foul on one another, thro' miſtake.</p>
               <p>The 19. The Trenches were Reliev'd by the Prince of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Major General <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Petteau,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis</hi> Brigadeer, and we continued our Approaches towards the ſaid Redoubt; which the King gave Order ſhould be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the next day.</p>
               <p>The 20. The Trenches were Reliev'd by Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sidny,</hi> and Count <hi>Naſſau</hi> Major Generals, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadeer <hi>Stewart;</hi> the Signal was given by Three Guns, about Two in the Afternoon, when our Men that were Detached for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to the number of about 150 (choice Select Men) beſides Officers, immediately fell on, and with extraordinary Courage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Fort, and drave out the Enemy, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about 40 of them. After we had been about half an hour in poſſeſſion of the Fort, the Enemy made a great Sally, Horſe and Foot, in all about Two Thouſand; but they were ſo warmly receiv'd by our Men, that after a ſhort Diſpute they were beaten back; our Horſe purſuing them to the very Walls of the Town.</p>
               <p>The 21. We carried on our Trenches, and finiſhed them to that degree, ſo as to hinder any more Sallies.</p>
               <p>The 22. We raiſed a Battery of Eight Guns, and Twenty four pound Ball, and two of Eighteen, againſt the Enemies high Towers, from whence they Fired upon our Men, and we have quite levelled them. The Night following we threw great numbers of Bombs and Carcaſſes into the Town, and Burnt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Houſes.</p>
               <p>The 23. This Morning one of <hi>Gilmey</hi>'s Troopers came over to us, and brought with him a Boy, and Four very good Horſes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Noon Two Captains, a Lieutenant, a Prieſt, and Seventy common Soldiers of the Enemy were brought in Priſoners from <hi>Nighua,</hi> a conſiderable Caſtle Two Miles from our Camp, where General <hi>Gnikle</hi> Marcht with Two Thouſand Horſe, Six Hundred Dragoons, a Regiment of Foot, and Two Guns, the Caſtle indured a Siege of Twenty Four hours, and then Surrendred on Diſcretion. This After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Two <hi>French-Men</hi> came over to us, and brought with them Two as good Horſes as any in our Army, they gave us an account that the Rogues in the City are in a miſerable condition for want of Bread and Drink, but that Meat is plenty among them. This Night about Seven in the Evening, we Played furiouſly into the Town, with our Bombs, Red hot Balls, and other Fire-Engines, which Fired the Town in ſeveral Places, one fell into their great Magazine of Hay, which was conſumed, and ſeveral Houſes Burnt, the Fire laſting there about Six hours, another
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94881:13"/>
ſet Fire to a place near the Church, which was not conſumed till Five the next Morning, and as that was quenched, we Fired another place, which was Blown up by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The 24. This Morning our Guns Fired very briskly at the Walls, but being too far off did little Execution, ſo that Two new Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries were this day made within Eighty Paces of the Wall, and our Trenches were carried on by the indefatigable labour of our Men, within Piſtol-ſhot of the Counterſcarp, and our Guns were carried this Night down to the ſaid Batteries, firſt againſt the Wall, of Eight half Cannon, the other of Two Eighteen Pounders againſt the <hi>King's-Iſland.</hi> This Night a Deſerter came over to us, who ſays, our Fire Utenſils, and great Shot have done them much damage, deſtroying at leaſt Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty People.</p>
               <p>The 25. This Morning about break of day, we began to Fire from our new Batteries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wall, but it Rained ſo hard till Three in the Afternoon, that our Men could not work the Guns, however on any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Rain, our Guns Play'd violently againſt the Walls, and from Three we fired at leaſt 300 Shot with good Succeſs againſt the Wall; had not this day proved ſo wet, we had Stormed the Counterſcarp, however we advanced our Trenches within 30 yards of the Ditch. A Deſerter that came out of the Town inform'd us, That the day we took the Redoubt, the Enemy loſt above 300 Men.</p>
               <p>The 26. We widened the Breach we had made the day before in the Wall of the Town, and beat down part of the Enemies Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's on the Counterſcarp. This Night we ſet Fire to the Town again, which Burnt very vehemently. A Deſerter gives us an account, That Colonel <hi>Darington,</hi> Colonel <hi>Gar. More,</hi> Sir <hi>Maurice Hueſtas,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Lutterel</hi> were Killed in the Sally.</p>
               <p>The 27. The King ordered an Attack to be made on the Counterſcarp, which was begun about Three in the Afternoon; a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Party of Granadeers made the onſet, and was ſeconded by other Detachments, who went on with that Heat and Courage, that having gained the Counterſcarp, and a Fort which the Enemy had under the Walls, inſtead of lodging themſelves there, as they were ordered to do, and not to advance any further, they mounted the Counterſcarp, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that fled that way, and ſome were entring into the Town; but the Enemy being Intrenched behind the Breach, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Planted Cannon againſt it, they were cut off. The Fight laſted Three hours, during which the Enemy were ſtill ſupplied with freſh Men, and they ſprang a Mine in the Ditch, but with little Effect; but in concluſion, our Men having loſt the opportunity of Lodging themſelves, it was thought fit to retire to our Trenches. What Men we have loſt in theſe ſeveral Actions we cannot preciſely ſay, but by the beſt Computation and niceſt Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the moſt Intelligent Obſervers, it's thought we may have loſt about 700. Killed and Wounded ſince the beginning of the Siege.</p>
               <p>The 28. At Night we advanced our Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about 20 Yards, notwithſtanding it had Rained moſt part of the Day; it continued to Rain all this Night, and all the next day to the 30th, almoſt without Intermiſſion: On which a Council of War being Called, where, as is ſaid, the following Reaſons (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others) being urged, His Majeſty thought fit to give Order for the raiſing the Siege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> 
                  <q>That the Rain that had fallen, and in all probability was likely to fall, would in a little time ſo moiſten the Ground about <hi>Lymerick,</hi> that it would be impoſſible to draw off the Cannon and heavy Baggage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                  <q>That the River <hi>Shannon</hi> began ſo to ſwell, that if they did not ſuddenly Paſs the ſame, the Communication with the other part of the Army would be cut off.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 
                  <q>The Watry Seaſon would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly bring the Country Diſtemper on our Army, and ſo more dye of it than by the hand of the Enemy; in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they did the laſt Campaign at <hi>Dundalk.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 
                  <q>That the Garriſon of <hi>Lymerick</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94881:13"/>
being very numerous, if they abide any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault (which on the account of the Weather muſt be made with great diſadvantage) we ſhould loſe a great many Men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The 30. In the Afternoon the Cannon and heavy Baggage were ſent from the Camp.</p>
               <p>On the 31. Five Thouſand Horſe being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for a Rear-Guard to Repreſs any Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the whole Army Decamped, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off in very good Order, and without any diſturbance from the Enemy, towards <hi>Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel;</hi> from whence a ſtrong Detachment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas,</hi> and Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kin-ſale.</hi> His Majeſty having given the neceſſary Orders, diſpoſed the Army, and named the Lord Viſcount <hi>Sidney,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Coningsby,</hi> Eſquire, to be Lords Juſtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> went, accompanied with the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to <hi>Duncannon</hi>-Fort.</p>
               <p>And on the 5th, in the Afternoon (the Wind proving fair) they Embarked, and Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Bay of <hi>Waterford,</hi> accompanied with Three Yatches, Two Men of War, and ſeveral ſmall Tenders.</p>
               <p>On the 6th, About Five in the Evening, His Majeſty Arrived ſafely in <hi>Kings-Road:</hi> His Majeſty being come a Shore, lay that Night at <hi>Kings-Weſton</hi> not far from <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 7th, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> in the Morning, His Majeſty went to <hi>Bath,</hi> and lay the Night following at the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s at <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> 7th, His Majeſty lay at the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s at <hi>Marlborough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday</hi> 8th, His Majeſty lay at the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday</hi> 9th, About Four in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon His Majeſty came to <hi>Kinſinton,</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the great Officers of the Court, and other Perſons of the chiefeſt Quality, who went to meet him.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty was receiv'd in all the places he paſſed through with moſt zealous Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Duty and Affection, and Joy for His Safe and Happy Return.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="postscript">
               <head>POST-SCRIPT.</head>
               <p>'TIS equally hard to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther His Majeſty, in the Action of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> or in His Decamping before <hi>Lymerick,</hi> has ſhewed moſt of a General: In the one he gave inimitable proofs of His Courage and Bravery, and to it alone we ow'd the Victory: But in Riſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lymerick,</hi> when Three of the Four Elements conſpired to the utter undoing of His Army if He had ſtaid, He has given yet a Nobler Proof of a conſummated Prudence, Warineſs and Conduct, ſeldom or never to be found in Company with ſo boundleſs a Courage. In this He has imitated <hi>Zenophous Cyrus,</hi> who valued himſelf more upon the Title of, the Father of his Soldiers, than all the great Names his <hi>Perſian</hi> Admirers beſtowed upon him; and who was heard often to ſay, <hi>He had rather Save one of his own, than Cut off a Thouſand of his Enemies.</hi> One of the greateſt Men of the laſt Age, in his Dying Advice to his Son, who was to Succeed him in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> tells him, <hi>'Tis one of the trueſt Politicks of a King, or a General, to know the Critick Moment wherein 'tis fit to abandon the Enterpriſe; for want of which fore-ſight on the one hand</hi> (adds <hi>Philip</hi> II.) <hi>the greateſt Misfortunes have befallen them; as on the other hand,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94881:14"/>
the exact obſervance of it has produced, in the end, the greateſt and happieſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</hi> Thereafter he gives his Son ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral incident Circumſtances, that ought to determine a King or a General when 'tis time to leave off the preſent Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Deſign, whereof this is one; <q>When Nature, and Things not in our Power do concur, to render the Attempt either impoſſible of it ſelf, or not able to counter-balance the Expence, though it ſhould ſucceed.</q> One would almoſt think that in theſe Words, <hi>Philip,</hi> by I know not what Inſtinct, ſhould have meant this Advice to the great Grand-child of his inveterate Enemy <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to <hi>Philip</hi> the III. for it meets in every Act with His Majeſties Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lymerick:</hi> It was the ſwelling of the <hi>Shannon,</hi> the falling down of the Buckets of Heaven, the nature of the Soil, and the approaching Seaſon of the Year, all of them things not lying within our Power, that rendred the Enterpriſe upon <hi>Lymerick,</hi> either impoſſible, or if at all Succeſsful, not capable to Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance the certain inconveniences and Loſſes that muſt have attended it.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, That in all the Actions of War, there is none wherein a General, has occaſion to ſhew more of his Wiſdom, than in Beſieging of Towns; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether to continue or raiſe a Siege, many times is the trueſt Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of his Skill, both in War and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. How many diſmal Examples could there be inſtanced from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians, of continuing a Siege too long, in ſpite of juſt reaſon to the contrary: A famous inſtance of which we have in the preceding Age, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the loſs of a Battle to the <hi>French</hi> Army, of the Dutchy of <hi>Millan</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Crown, and of his Liberty to a <hi>French</hi> King. <hi>Francis</hi> I. having forced his Paſſage into <hi>Italy,</hi> in order to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his pretended Right to the Dutchy of <hi>Millan;</hi> he came at firſt to lay Siege to the Strong Caſtle of <hi>Pavie,</hi> with a very brave and numerous Army: At firſt the Enterprize ſeemed very favourable; but a little after, <hi>partly by the ſwelling of the River, partly by the continual Rains, and partly from the Seaſon of the Year,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Army began to diminiſh daily, and then the hopes of Taking the Town every day grew leſs. Notwithſtanding all theſe Circumſtances, which ought in reaſon to have determined <hi>Francis</hi> I. to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Pavie</hi> (as the very like has wiſely determined His Majeſty to raiſe that of <hi>Lymerick;</hi>) That Prince would not be prevailed with, by all the Inſinuations of his beſt Officers, to give it over for that Juncture: In ſhort, he lay before the Town till he was forced to a Battle, the moſt Fatal the <hi>French</hi> have Fought near theſe Three Ages; in which he was taken Priſoner, and had the Mortification to be carried to <hi>Madrid</hi> in that Quality.</p>
